# SMOD2-ItemSpawner
Custom item spawns for everybody. Yay.

## This plugin is really early in its release, but has some nifty features nonetheless

# Current usage

`items.txt` file format:
`RoomType:ItemType:Probability:Vector:Rotation` where RoomType comes from this list: https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/wiki/Enum-Lists#roomtype and ItemTypes from this: https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/wiki/Enum-Lists#itemtype; probability takes a float number (75.48 for example); and both Vector and Rotation take things like `5,1.48,10:1,0,0`

The only command as of now is `coinfetcher` and locked to admins and owners to avoid delays caused by any other role, and shows the whole format to place in `items.txt`

## Future implementations will have commands to add new items from the in-game R.A. console.
## I haven't really had time to add more stuff and more item spawns, because my plan is just leaving this game when SCP: Ascension comes out, so I rather spend my time doing other stuff.
